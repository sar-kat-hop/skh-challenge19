# Module 19: PWA Challenge ("JATE" text editor)

## About
"Just Another Text Editor" (JATE) is a simple text editor PWA using WebPack and a variety of loaders and wrappers, including: Babel, Mini CSS Extract Plugin, HTML Webpack Plugin, CSS Style Loader, Webpack PWA Manifest, and Workbox. It also makes use of the idb wrapper for IndexedDB.

Note: JATE is still very much a WIP and not fully up and running. Content is saved to IndexedDB but not rendered to the page again on refresh, the header is not being rendered any longer, and the app cannot be installed locally for offline use. (Offline use in general isn't functional due to a problem with registering the service worker).

## Install / Deployment
When the app is functional, a link to the Heroku deployment will be included here. (Not currently deployed)
